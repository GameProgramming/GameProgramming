Yeti Tournament

Game Instructions:
You are a Yeti in an epic snowball fight. The goal is to defeat the other enemy yetis and decrease the ticket amount of the enemy team to zero.

With a right click you can burp.

Furthermore you can capture the flag points (the coloured candy canes). If you captured a flag point, you can spawn there if you wish. You can also heal yourself when you stand nearby a captured flag point.

There are also snow ressources in the field. If you stand inside these ressources you restock your snowball ammunition, which is shown in the lower right corner of your screen. Additionally you can create big snowballs by holding "E", when standing inside a snow ressource. You can shoot those big snowballs by left clicking or you can convert those big snowballs into snow ressources by right clicking.
