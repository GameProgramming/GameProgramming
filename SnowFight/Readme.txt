-----------   Game Description   -----------
--------------------------------------------


You are a Yeti in an epic snowball fight. The goal is to defeat the other
enemy yetis by throwing snowballs at them and decrease the ticket amount
of the enemy team to zero. The actual ticket amount is shown in the upper
left corner of your screen. Every time a Yeti dies, the ticket amount
decreases by one. In the upper right corner of the screen you can see
frag labels, which player killed another player. In the lower left corner
of the screen you can see your actual health status.

Furthermore you can capture the flag points (the coloured candy canes).
If you captured a flag point, you can spawn there if you wish. You can
also heal yourself when you stand nearby a captured flag point.

There are also snow ressources in the field. If you stand inside these
ressources you restock your snowball ammunition, which is shown in the
lower right corner of your screen. Additionally you can create big
snowballs, when standing inside a snow ressource. You can shoot those big
snowballs or you can convert those big snowballs into new snow ressources.
You can also roll the big snowballs to a flag point and convert them into
a special weapon.

Special Weapons:
UFO: If you enter an UFO you can freeze other yetis by using the freezing
ray. Besides you can shoot other UFOs with a cannon. The freezing ray amount
is shown in the lower right corner of your screen.
Rocket launcher: With the rocket launcher you can target an UFO by holding
the aim point over the UFO. Hold this point over the UFO until you locked
it and then shoot to throw the rocket. It will follow the UFO until it has
been hit. The amount of the ammunition for the rocket launcher is shown
in the lower right corner of your screen.
