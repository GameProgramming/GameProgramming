Yeti Tournament

Game Instructions:
You are a Yeti in an epic snowball fight. The goal is to defeat the other enemy yetis and decrease the ticket amount of the enemy team to zero. The actual ticket amount is shown in the upper left corner of your screen. Every time a Yeti dies, the ticket amount decreases by one. You can shoot other Yetis by left clicking. With a right click you can burp.

Furthermore you can capture the flag points (the coloured candy canes). If you captured a flag point, you can spawn there if you wish. You can also heal yourself when you stand nearby a captured flag point.

There are also snow ressources in the field. If you stand inside these ressources you restock your snowball ammunition, which is shown in the lower right corner of your screen. Additionally you can create big snowballs by holding "E", when standing inside a snow ressource. You can shoot those big snowballs by left clicking or you can convert those big snowballs into snow ressources by right clicking. You can also roll the big snowballs to a flag point and convert them into a special weapon.

Special weapons:
In general you can use items when standing next to them and press "E".

UFO: If you enter an UFO you can freeze other yetis by using the freezing ray with a right click. Besides you can shoot other UFOs with a cannon by left clicking.
Rocket launcher: With the rocket launcher you can target an UFO by holding the aim point over the UFO. Hold this point over the UFO until you locked it and then left click that the rocket follows the UFO and hits it.
