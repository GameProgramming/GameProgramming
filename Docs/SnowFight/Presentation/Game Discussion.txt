For both games we had a great feedback and to my mind they were fascinated ;)

States of matter:
- Graphical content is important according to Johannes
- Level design is important
- States changes (Mechanic)? Restrictions?

Snow Fight:
- 3D/2D design, camera movement
- Classical game mechanism, what´s the game
- Confused with UFO, Yeti, Cannon (ist nicht gut angekommen bei den anderen)
- Different solid states of the snow
- CS: Snowball fight mod
- Pretty hard done in a semester according to Thomas
- Technical risks
